/**
 * 3342. Find Minimum Time to Reach Last Room II
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-reach-last-room-ii/
 *
 * Description:
 * There is a dungeon with n x m rooms arranged as a grid.
 * You are given a 2D array moveTime of size n x m, where moveTime[i][j] represents the minimum time in seconds when you can 
 * start moving to that room. You start from the room (0, 0) at time t = 0 and can move to an adjacent room. Moving between 
 * adjacent rooms takes one second for one move and two seconds for the next, alternating between the two.
 * 
 * Return the minimum time to reach the room (n - 1, m - 1).
 * 
 * Two rooms are adjacent if they share a common wall, either horizontally or vertically.
 *
 * Difficulty: Medium
